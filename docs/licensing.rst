About Licensing

This is not the license, but contributors should read this as well as users!

Please use this software! 

It was hard to decide on a license. 

Creative Commmons seems ill-suited, though I did consider the most
permissive version. 

Copyleft is attractive, as I'd like free improvements from users,
but I don't want that to be mandatory or for users to decline to use
it from that restriction.

BSD and MIT both seemed apt, so I went with MIT.

So you do not have the legal obligation to give me your improvements.
However, I will suggest you have the moral and ethical obligation to
do so in the spirit of mutually cooperating members of society. 

Appreciated but not required are: contributions of improvements back to this library,
attribution beyond that required by the license, and shareholder equity in your startups.

By making contributions you assign any rights to the code you submit to the primary
author, Aaron Hall, unconditionally, until such time as I get good advice
that persuades me otherwise.

Again, this is not the actual license, see the LICENSE file for the actual licensing terms.
